Also recall polynomial regression: a large number of features can lead to overfitting. Feature selection helps curb the problem of the curse of dimensionality, where centrality measures often used in statistics go wonky at higher dimensions. Between feature-engineering which we did some of, earlier, and feature selection, is where a lot of smarts and domain knowledge comes in. You will gain this with experience."

    "Its very important to do response based feature selection in the right way. If you remember, we separately standardized the training and test sets. This was to prevent **any** information about the overall mean and standard deviation leaking into the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we played a bit loose with the rules there. We standardized on the entire training set. Instead we should have been standardizing separately in each cross-validation fold. There the original training set would be broken up into a sub-training and validation set, the standardization needed to be done on those separately. This can be implemented with `sklearn` pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such kind of \"data snooping\" is relatively benign though, as it used no information about the response variable. But if you do any feature selection which uses the response variable, such as choosing the \"k\" most correlated variables from above, its not benign any more. This is because you have leaked the response from the validation into your sub-training set, and cannot thus be confident about your predictions: you might overfit. In such a situation, you must do the feature selection inside the cross-validation fold. See http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/lec_10_cross_val.ipynb from the 2013 course for a particularly dastardly case of this, where you see that the problem is particularly exacerbated when you have many more features than samples.\n",

Then, we take the sample with the next highest score, and call it positive. As we go down the list, we go down a threshold in score or probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each such situation: only 1 positive, now 2 positive,....you can imagine a different classifier with a different confusion matrix. It will have its own false positives, three positives, etc. Its actually the same original classifier, but with a different threshold each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we keep going down the list, decreasing the threshold, more and more samples become positive, and at first, the true positives rise faster than the false positives. Once past a certain point, false positives increase faster than true positives. Now, if you want a balanced classifier, you look at this turn-around point...the northwest corner, so to speak. But if you want a classifier which penalizes false positives and false negatives differently, the point you want is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a ROC curve you plot the True Positive Rate, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$TPR=\\frac{TP}{OP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "against the False Positive Rate,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$FPR=\\frac{FP}{ON}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as you go through this process of going down the list of samples. ROC curves are useful because they calculate one classifier per threshold and show you where you are in TPR/FPR space without making any assumptions about the utility matrix or which threshold is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A rote reading of the ROC curve (go to the \"northwest\" corner) is a bad idea: you must fold in the curve with any assumptions you are making about the utilities. In our case we have both an asymmetric data set, and asymmetric risk, so the north west corner may not be the right spot. Still, on the whole, a curve with a greater AUC (area under curve), or further away from the line of randomness, will give us a rough idea of what might be a better classifier."

    "The proof is always in the pudding. So far we have seen the ROC curve which implements one classifier per threshold to pick an appropriate model. But why not just plot the profit on a ROC like curve to see which classifier maximizes profit? \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a ROC curve, we go down the sorted (by score or probability) list of samples. We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. In addition to what we do for the ROC curve, we now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",

    "We provide code to plot a profit curve below, to which we must provide two critical functions:\n",
